## Imagine Cup

At the end of April, after several round of area final competition, 2016 Imagine Cup China Local Final was held in Sanya, Hainan province, while thirty MSPs came to Sanya from all around China to participate in 2016 MSP China Summit and record the greate feast of Imagine Cup.

Accompanied by the scorching weather of Sanya, we burst our bigest passion of youth. Follow competitors, shoot the competition and summit, write media broadcast script, stay up the whole night to cut and render videos.

## On the way

MSP program is not only a organization aimed to help and win the Imagine Cup. On the local final we choreographed and practiced dancing once and once more times for the dinner party of the next day. We trained on the downstairs, in the bathroom, on every moments we got for rest, and we taught each other, we helped each other, during which we became closed partners and friends, brothers in arms. It would huge growth for all of us.

So, the Imagine Tour of 2016 is also the story of growth.
